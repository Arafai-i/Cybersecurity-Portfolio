# Intrusion Detection Lab (Snort + Ubuntu + Metasploitable + Kali) üîç

## Overview
A small IDS lab built using Ubuntu (running Snort), Metasploitable 2 machines on an internal network, and Kali Linux as an external attacker system.  
The goal is to detect network traffic (ICMP, port scans, etc.) using Snort rules and analyze alerts.
